# Penpi
An attempt to read IMU data and cast it, normalized, to a website.

# Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Connect an IMU and get it on the network. For our purposes, we used [this guide](https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/how-to-interface-an-imu-sensor-with-a-raspberry-pi)

# Running the website
1. ssh into the pi (pi@calamari on our case)
2. activate python env ( by running ```./run_penpi_server.sh```)
3. Go to the IP and view data!
